Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

i thought the simulations/time curve wouldn't be as steep.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

context determines tolerance.
1000000 sims doesn't seem worth it, obviously, but depending on context, from 1000-100000 sims seems appropriate.
