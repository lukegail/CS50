Spotify Wrapped

Spotify Wrapped is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs from the past year.
In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “Audio Aura” for each user, a “reading of [their] two most prominent moods
as dictated by [their] top songs and artists of the year.”
Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence,
and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year. In answers.txt, reflect on the following questions:

    1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
    how would you characterize their audio aura?

SELECT AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(valence) FROM songs;

AVG(danceability)  AVG(energy)  AVG(valence)
-----------------  -----------  ------------
0.71646            0.65906      0.484443


    2. Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
    What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

i found the average of each category, but the need to find TWO moods.
To find the two most prominent moods of a person's top 100 songs from the past year,
Spotify calculates the average energy, valence, and danceability of those songs.
Then, they likely use clustering algorithms to group the songs into two clusters based on those three features.
The two clusters represent the two most prominent moods of the person's listening habits.
